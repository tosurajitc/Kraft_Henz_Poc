gRPC Typing Stubs for Python
============================

This is a PEP-561-compliant stub-only package which provides type information of
[gRPC](https://grpc.io>).

Install using pip:

    pip install grpc-stubs


Tests (courtesy of [pytest-mypy-plugins](https://github.com/typeddjango/pytest-mypy-plugins>):

    pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
    ./tools.sh test


## Call for assistance

There are several areas where `grpc-stubs` could use some TLC. If you'd like to
help with any of this, please reach out.


### Maintainers

It's unlikely I'll be returning to grpc full-time for the foreseeable future,
and my knowledge of the minutiae fades with each passing year. If anyone wishes
to assume maintainership of this project ongoing, please reach out. An attempt to
merge into typeshed is underway here: https://github.com/python/typeshed/pull/11204


## Python Support

grpc-stubs is tested with 3.7 or later, but ideally it should support Python 3.6 as
grpc still supports this. Python 3.6 had to be disabled in the tests due to
various cascading fiascos and a lack of time to contend with them. Feel free
to submit a PR if you'd like to see it returned, or open issues. Ensure that
you supply an MRE as per the contributing guidelines below.


## Contributing

### Minimum Reproducible Examples (MRE)

Unfortunately, due to the fussy nature of `grpc` and its dependencies, and the
huge amount of time required to construct a context in which to verify and
debug issues, starting from 2022-04-16, fairly strict issue and pull request
templates have been added.

Minimum Reproducible Examples are now a hard requirement for pull requests that
touch the typing surface, and a soft requirement for issues. PRs without a
functioning MRE transfer the burden entirely from the contributor to the
maintainer, and I simply don't have time to do the deep-dives required to build
out MREs from scratch when issues inevitably crop up. PRs without a trivially
executable MRE will be closed without further consideration; of course you are
always welcome to reopen once you have added a verified MRE!


### Tests

This project uses a slightly old version of
https://github.com/TypedDjango/pytest-mypy-plugins for testing. All new
contributions will be required to include at least one, but probably multiple
tests. See `typesafety/test_*.yml`.


### Code-generated stubs

PRs containing auto-generated stubs have had to be reverted several times due
to issues. Starting from 2022-04-16, autogenerated stubs from `mypy-protobuf`
will not be accepted without extensive tests, and will not be accepted with
edit warnings left in. It's ok to use this tool to seed stubs, but not to
refresh stubs - once contributed to this repo, the stubs should be presumed to
have been written by hand.
